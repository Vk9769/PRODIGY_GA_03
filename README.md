# Markov Chain Text Generation

A simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. This project creates a statistical model that predicts the probability of a word based on the previous ones and generates text based on this model.

## Overview

This project implements a word-level Markov chain model to generate text. The model is built using an excerpt from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. The generated text aims to be coherent and familiar by considering the probabilities of word sequences in the input corpus.

## Features

- Build a word-level Markov chain from a given text corpus.
- Generate text based on the Markov chain model.
- Adjustable Markov chain order (higher-order chains result in more coherent text).

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markov-chain-text-generation.git
    cd markov-chain-text-generation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to generate text:
    ```sh
    python markov_chain_text_generation.py
    ```

2. The script will output a generated text based on the Markov chain model built from the input corpus.

### Example

An example of generated text could be:
